<ul>
	{#each posts as post}
		<!-- we're using the non-standard `rel=prefetch` attribute to
				tell Sapper to load the data for the page as soon as
				the user hovers over the link or taps it, instead of
				waiting for the 'click' event -->
		<li><a rel='prefetch' href='{post.slug}'>{post.title}</a></li>
	{/each}
</ul>
